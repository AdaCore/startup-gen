This is the home of the GNAT bare board project generator.

The project is decomposed in 3 tools:
+ The first one is a script that generates a `knowledge-database` for all the
CMSIS-packs hosted at https://www.keil.com/dd2/pack/. It would put in common
shared resources such as the interrupt vector.

+ The second one will generate GPR files that describe the selected device.
For example, for a device with 256 bytes of ROM starting at 0, we would have:

```Ada
        for Memories use ("RAM1", "ROM1")
        for Size("ROM1") use "0x1000";
        for Start("ROM1") use "0x0";
```
Or alternatively

```Ada
        for Attributes("ROM1") use "start=0x0;size=0x1000";
```

This tool would also allow the user to update the used knowledge database to the
most recent one.
The interrupt vector would also be described that way but would be in a separate
GPR file.

+ The final tool would take as input the GPR files of generated by the second
tool and would generate the matching startup code, memory map, linker script and
interrupt vector. The idea would be to consider this step as an extra step in
the compilation process and the generated file would be considered as artifacts
of the compilation process.

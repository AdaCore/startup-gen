This is the home of the GNAT bare board project generator.

The project is composed of 3 tools:
+ The first tool (aptly named `querytool`) is a python module that can setup a
  database as well as interacting with it. It provides high level functions so
  that the user of that module does not have to write SQL queries.

+ JSON2GPR : This tool will convert json to gpr files, this tool is
  used to translate the output of the database to form valid project files.

For example, for a device with 256 bytes of ROM starting at 0, we would have:

```Ada
   package Memory_Map is

      --  MEMORY MAP
      for Memories use ("FLASH"); --  Declaring memory regions here

      for Boot_Memory use "FLASH";

      for Mem_Kind("FLASH") use "ROM";

      -- FLASH
      for Address("FLASH") use "16#0#";
      for Size("FLASH")    use "16#1000#";

   end Memory_Map;

```

+ GPR2LD: The third tool would take as input the GPR files generated by the second
tool and would generate the matching startup code, memory map, linker script and
interrupt vector. Currently this tool supports all cortex-m processors except
for the cortex-m3 and supports only booting from ROM.

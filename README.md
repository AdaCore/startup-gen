This is the home of the GNAT bare board project generator.

The project is composed of 3 tools:
+ The first is a script that generates a `knowledge-database` for all the
CMSIS-packs hosted at https://www.keil.com/dd2/pack/. It would put in common
shared resources such as the interrupt vector.

+ The second tool will generate GPR files that describe the selected device.
For example, for a device with 256 bytes of ROM starting at 0, we would have:

```Ada
   package Memory_Map is

      --  MEMORY MAP
      for Memories use ("RAM");

      for Boot_Memory use "RAM";

      for Mem_Kind("RAM") use "RAM";

      -- RAM
      for Address("RAM") use "16#0#";
      for Size("RAM")    use "16#1000#";

   end Memory_Map;

```

This tool would also allow the user to update the used knowledge database to the
most recent one.
The interrupt vector would also be described that way but would be in a separate
GPR file.

+ GPR2LD: The third tool would take as input the GPR files generated by the second
tool and would generate the matching startup code, memory map, linker script and
interrupt vector. The idea would be to consider this step as an extra step in
the compilation process and the generated file would be considered as artifacts
of the compilation process.

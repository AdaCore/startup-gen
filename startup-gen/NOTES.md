+ There is no concept of mandatory switch in GNAT.Command_Line`
        + If you want parameters you must put them after all the switches.
        + Is there a way to register automatically arguments, especially
        for the documentation ?

+ Is there a way to make GNAT.Command_Line "cross-platorm-ish" ?
        + For example: / instead of - on windows
        + Or maybe let the user decide ?
        + Is it automatically done ?
